## Testing process

The test process was performed based on the standard test process as described below.

### 1.1 Test planning
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for all the modules from the Guru Bank application.
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.
### 1.1.1. Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated:
<table>
<tr></tr><td>Project manager</td> <td>John Smith</td> </tr>
<tr><td> Product owner</td> <td>Miguel Fernandez</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software developer</td> <td>Angi Paraschiv</td></tr>
<tr><td>QA Engineer</td> <td>Angelica Paraschiv</td></tr>
</table>

### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined 
**Product Analysis:**

- Identify functionalities, requirements, and associated risks.
 
**Testing Strategy:**
- Define how you will approach testing.
- Determine the types of tests (functional, performance, security, etc.) and priorities.
 
**Testing Objectives:**
- Specify what you want to validate through testing.
- Examples of objectives: correct functionality, performance, security, compatibility, etc.
 
**Testing Criteria:**
- _Suspension criteria:_ conditions under which testing should be stopped (e.g., unresolved critical defects).

**Completion of All Test Cases:**
- All planned test cases should be executed.
	This ensures comprehensive coverage of requirements and functionalities.
- Defect Closure:
	Critical defects should be resolved.
	A bypass strategy should be in place for any remaining medium-priority defects.
	Low-priority defects that do not significantly affect software usage can remain open.

- Module Manager
- Module Customer
	Usability Testing.
	Integration Testing.
        Unit Testing.

**Tests not in scope:**
